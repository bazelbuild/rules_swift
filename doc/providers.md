The providers described below are propagated and required by various Swift
build rules. Clients interested in writing custom rules that interface
with the rules in this package should use these providers to communicate
with the Swift build rules as needed.

## SwiftGRPCInfo

<pre>
SwiftGRPCInfo(<a href="#SwiftGRPCInfo-flavor">flavor</a>, <a href="#SwiftGRPCInfo-direct_pbgrpc_files">direct_pbgrpc_files</a>)
</pre>

Propagates Swift-specific information about a `swift_grpc_library`.

**FIELDS**


| Name  | Description |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| <a id="SwiftGRPCInfo-flavor"></a>flavor |  The flavor of GRPC that was generated. E.g. server, client, or client_stubs.    |
| <a id="SwiftGRPCInfo-direct_pbgrpc_files"></a>direct_pbgrpc_files |  `Depset` of `File`s. The Swift source files (`.grpc.swift`) generated from the `.proto` files in direct dependencies.    |


<a id="SwiftInfo"></a>

## SwiftInfo

<pre>
SwiftInfo(<a href="#SwiftInfo-direct_modules">direct_modules</a>, <a href="#SwiftInfo-transitive_modules">transitive_modules</a>)
</pre>

Contains information about the compiled artifacts of a Swift module.

This provider contains a large number of fields and many custom rules may not
need to set all of them. Instead of constructing a `SwiftInfo` provider
directly, consider using the `swift_common.create_swift_info` function, which
has reasonable defaults for any fields not explicitly set.

**FIELDS**


| Name  | Description |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| <a id="SwiftInfo-direct_modules"></a>direct_modules |  `List` of values returned from `swift_common.create_module`. The modules (both Swift and C/Objective-C) emitted by the library that propagated this provider.    |
| <a id="SwiftInfo-transitive_modules"></a>transitive_modules |  `Depset` of values returned from `swift_common.create_module`. The transitive modules (both Swift and C/Objective-C) emitted by the library that propagated this provider and all of its dependencies.    |


<a id="SwiftProtoInfo"></a>

## SwiftProtoInfo

<pre>
SwiftProtoInfo(<a href="#SwiftProtoInfo-module_mappings">module_mappings</a>, <a href="#SwiftProtoInfo-pbswift_files">pbswift_files</a>, <a href="#SwiftProtoInfo-direct_pbswift_files">direct_pbswift_files</a>)
</pre>

Propagates Swift-specific information about a `proto_library`.

**FIELDS**


| Name  | Description |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| <a id="SwiftProtoInfo-module_mappings"></a>module_mappings |  `Sequence` of `struct`s. Each struct contains `module_name` and `proto_file_paths` fields that denote the transitive mappings from `.proto` files to Swift modules. This allows messages that reference messages in other libraries to import those modules in generated code.    |
| <a id="SwiftProtoInfo-pbswift_files"></a>pbswift_files |  `Depset` of `File`s. The transitive Swift source files (`.pb.swift`) generated from the `.proto` files.    |
| <a id="SwiftProtoInfo-direct_pbswift_files"></a>direct_pbswift_files |  `list` of `File`s. The Swift source files (`.pb.swift`) generated from the `.proto` files in direct dependencies.    |


<a id="SwiftToolchainInfo"></a>

## SwiftToolchainInfo

<pre>
SwiftToolchainInfo(<a href="#SwiftToolchainInfo-action_configs">action_configs</a>, <a href="#SwiftToolchainInfo-cc_toolchain_info">cc_toolchain_info</a>, <a href="#SwiftToolchainInfo-clang_implicit_deps_providers">clang_implicit_deps_providers</a>, <a href="#SwiftToolchainInfo-developer_dirs">developer_dirs</a>,

                   <a href="#SwiftToolchainInfo-test_configuration">test_configuration</a>, <a href="#SwiftToolchainInfo-tool_configs">tool_configs</a>, <a href="#SwiftToolchainInfo-unsupported_features">unsupported_features</a>)
</pre>

that use the toolchain.

| <a id="SwiftToolchainInfo-swift_worker"></a>swift_worker |  `File`. The executable representing the worker executable used to invoke the compiler and other Swift tools (for both incremental and non-incremental compiles).    |
