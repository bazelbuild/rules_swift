Collects compilation statistics reports from the entire build graph.

This aspect is intended to be used from the command line to profile the Swift
compiler during a build. It needs to be combined with the `swift.compile_stats`
feature that asks the compiler to write out the statistics and a request for the
`swift_compile_stats` output group so that the files are available at the end of
the build:

```
bazel build //your/swift:target \
    --features=swift.compile_stats \
    --output_groups=swift_compile_stats \
    --aspects=@build_bazel_rules_swift//swift:stats.bzl%collect_swift_compile_stats
```

Since this command is a bit of a mouthful, we've provided a helper script in the
tools directory that wraps this up:

```
.../tools/compile_stats/build.sh <args to pass to Bazel>
```
""",
    implementation = _collect_swift_compile_stats_impl,
