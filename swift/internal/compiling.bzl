    *   If the package component is non-empty after the above transformation,
        it is joined with the transformed name component using an underscore.
        Otherwise, the transformed name is used by itself.
    *   If this would result in a string that begins with a digit (`0-9`), an

            the Clang module substructure should be propagated by the `CcInfo`
            provider of the calling rule.

        *   `compilation_outputs`: A `CcCompilationOutputs` object (as returned
            by `cc_common.create_compilation_outputs`) that contains the
            compiled object files.

        *   `supplemental_outputs`: A `struct` representing supplemental,
            optional outputs. Its fields are:

            *   `ast_files`: A list of `File`s output from the `DUMP_AST`

                representations of constant values extracted from the source
                files, if requested via a direct dependency.

            *   `indexstore_directory`: A directory-type `File` that represents
                the indexstore output files created when the feature
                `swift.index_while_building` is enabled.
