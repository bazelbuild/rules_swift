            requirements of the target being compiled, such as Swift-compatible
            preprocessor defines, header search paths, and so forth. These are
            typically retrieved from a target's dependencies.
        copts: A list of compiler flags that apply to the target being built.
            These flags, along with those from Bazel's Swift configuration
            fragment (i.e., `--swiftcopt` command line flags) are scanned to
            determine whether whole module optimization is being requested,
            which affects the nature of the output files.
        defines: Symbols that should be defined by passing `-D` to the compiler.
        exec_group: Runs the Swift compilation action under the given execution
            group's context. If `None`, the default execution group is used.
        extra_swift_infos: Extra `SwiftInfo` providers that aren't contained
            by the `deps` of the target being compiled but are required for
            compilation.
        feature_configuration: A feature configuration obtained from

            release. Use the `include_dev_srch_paths` attribute instead.
            Represents if the `testonly` value of the context.
        include_dev_srch_paths: A `bool` that indicates whether the developer
            framework search paths will be added to the compilation command.
        generated_header_name: The name of the Objective-C generated header that
            should be generated for this module. If omitted, no header will be
            generated.
        module_name: The name of the Swift module being compiled. This must be
            present and valid; use `derive_swift_module_name` to generate a
            default from the target's label if needed.
        package_name: The semantic package of the name of the Swift module
            being compiled.
        plugins: A list of `SwiftCompilerPluginInfo` providers that represent
            plugins that should be loaded by the compiler.
        private_cc_infos: A list of `CcInfos`s that represent private
            (non-propagated) C/Objective-C requirements of the target being
            compiled, such as Swift-compatible preprocessor defines, header
            search paths, and so forth. These are typically retrieved from a
            target's `private_deps`.
        private_swift_infos: A list of `SwiftInfo` providers from private
            (implementation-only) dependencies of the target being compiled. The
            modules defined by these providers are used as dependencies of the
            Swift module being compiled but not of the Clang module for the
            generated header.
        srcs: The Swift source files to compile.
        swift_infos: A list of `SwiftInfo` providers from non-private
            dependencies of the target being compiled. The modules defined by
            these providers are used as dependencies of both the Swift module
            being compiled and the Clang module for the generated header.
        swift_toolchain: The `SwiftToolchainInfo` provider of the toolchain.
        toolchain_type: A toolchain type of the `swift_toolchain` which is used
            for the proper selection of the execution platform inside
            `run_toolchain_action`.
        target_name: The name of the target for which the code is being
            compiled, which is used to determine unique file paths for the
            outputs.
        toolchain_type: The toolchain type of the `swift_toolchain` which is
            used for the proper selection of the execution platform inside
            `run_toolchain_action`.
        workspace_name: The name of the workspace for which the code is being
             compiled, which is used to determine unique file paths for some
             outputs.

    Returns:
        A `struct` with the following fields:

        *   `swift_info`: A `SwiftInfo` provider whose list of direct modules
            contains the single Swift module context produced by this function
            (identical to the `module_context` field below) and whose transitive
            modules represent the transitive non-private dependencies. Rule
            implementations that call this function can typically return this
            provider directly, except in rare cases like making multiple calls
            to `swift_common.compile` that need to be merged.

        *   `module_context`: A Swift module context (as returned by
            `create_swift_module_context`) that contains the Swift (and
            potentially C/Objective-C) compilation prerequisites of the compiled
            module. This should typically be propagated by a `SwiftInfo`
            provider of the calling rule, and the `CcCompilationContext` inside
            the Clang module substructure should be propagated by the `CcInfo`
            provider of the calling rule.

        *   `compilation_outputs`: A `CcCompilationOutputs` object (as returned
            by `cc_common.create_compilation_outputs`) that contains the
            compiled object files.

        *   `supplemental_outputs`: A `struct` representing supplemental,
            optional outputs. Its fields are:

            *   `ast_files`: A list of `File`s output from the `DUMP_AST`
                action.

            *   `const_values_files`: A list of `File`s that contains JSON
                representations of constant values extracted from the source
                files, if requested via a direct dependency.

            *   `indexstore_directory`: A directory-type `File` that represents
                the indexstore output files created when the feature
                `swift.index_while_building` is enabled.

            *   `macro_expansion_directory`: A directory-type `File` that
                represents the location where macro expansion files were written
                (only in debug/fastbuild and only when the toolchain supports
                macros).
