    This function is wrapped in a `partial` that will be propagated as part of the
    toolchain provider. The first three arguments are pre-bound; the `is_static`
    and `is_test` arguments are expected to be passed by the caller.

    Args:
        cc_toolchain: The cpp toolchain from which the `ld` executable is determined.
        os: The operating system name, which is used as part of the library path.
        toolchain_root: The toolchain's root directory.
        is_static: `True` to link against the static version of the Swift runtime, or `False` to
            link against dynamic/shared libraries.
        is_test: `True` if the target being linked is a test target.

        The command line options to pass to `clang` to link against the desired variant of the Swift
