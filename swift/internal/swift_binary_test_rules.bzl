Compiles and links Swift code into an executable test target.

The behavior of `swift_test` differs slightly for macOS targets, in order to
provide seamless integration with Apple's XCTest framework. The output of the
rule is still a binary, but one whose Mach-O type is `MH_BUNDLE` (a loadable
bundle). Thus, the binary cannot be launched directly. Instead, running
`bazel test` on the target will launch a test runner script that copies it into
an `.xctest` bundle directory and then launches the `xctest` helper tool from
Xcode, which uses Objective-C runtime reflection to locate the tests.

On Linux, the output of a `swift_test` is a standard executable binary, because
the implementation of XCTest on that platform currently requires authors to
explicitly list the tests that are present and run them from their main program.

Test bundling on macOS can be disabled on a per-target basis, if desired. You
may wish to do this if you are not using XCTest, but rather a different test
framework (or no framework at all) where the pass/fail outcome is represented as
a zero/non-zero exit code (as is the case with other Bazel test rules like
`cc_test`). To do so, disable the `"swift.bundled_xctests"` feature on the
target:

```python
swift_test(
    name = "MyTests",
    srcs = [...],
    features = ["-swift.bundled_xctests"],
)
```

You can also disable this feature for all the tests in a package by applying it
to your BUILD file's `package()` declaration instead of the individual targets.

If integrating with Xcode, the relative paths in test binaries can prevent the
Issue navigator from working for test failures. To work around this, you can
have the paths made absolute via swizzling by enabling the
`"apple.swizzle_absolute_xcttestsourcelocation"` feature. You'll also need to
set the `BUILD_WORKSPACE_DIRECTORY` environment variable in your scheme to the
root of your workspace (i.e. `$(SRCROOT)`).

A subset of tests for a given target can be executed via the `--test_filter` parameter:

```
bazel test //:Tests --test_filter=TestModuleName.TestClassName/testMethodName
