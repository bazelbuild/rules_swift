    This function calls through to `cc_common.configure_features` to configure
    underlying C++ features as well, and nests the C++ feature configuration
    inside the Swift one. Users who need to call C++ APIs that require a feature
    configuration can extract it by calling
    `swift_common.cc_feature_configuration(feature_configuration)`.

        ctx: The rule context.
        swift_toolchain: The `SwiftToolchainInfo` provider of the toolchain
            being used to build. This is used to determine features that are
            enabled by default or unsupported by the toolchain, and the C++
            toolchain associated with the Swift toolchain is used to create the
            underlying C++ feature configuration.
        requested_features: The list of features to be enabled. This is
            typically obtained using the `ctx.features` field in a rule
            implementation function.
        unsupported_features: The list of features that are unsupported by the
            current rule. This is typically obtained using the
            `ctx.disabled_features` field in a rule implementation function.

        An opaque value representing the feature configuration that can be
        passed to other `swift_common` functions. Note that the structure of
        this value should otherwise not be relied on or inspected directly.
