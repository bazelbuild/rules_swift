Attaches a `SwiftInfo` provider to any non-Swift target underneath a Swift target.

There are two reasons to attach a `SwiftInfo` provider to non-Swift targets:

*   For a `cc_library`, we want to generate a module map so that it can be imported directly by
    Swift, as well as propagate the merged `SwiftInfo`s of its children so that information from
    those dependencies isn't lost. (For example, consider a `swift_library` that depends on an
    `objc_library` that depends on a `swift_library`.)

    The modules generated by this aspect have names that are automatically derived from the label
    of the `cc_library` target, using the same logic used to derive the module names for Swift
    targets.

*   For any other target, we want to propagate the merged `SwiftInfo`s of its children.

These can't be separate aspects because they would both try to attach a `SwiftInfo`, and we don't
know which order they would run in.

This aspect is an implementation detail of the Swift build rules and is not meant to be attached
to other rules or run independently.
