Propagates unified `SwiftInfo` providers for targets that represent
C/Objective-C modules.

This aspect unifies the propagation of Clang module artifacts so that Swift
targets that depend on C/Objective-C targets can find the necessary module
artifacts, and so that Swift module artifacts are not lost when passing through
a non-Swift target in the build graph (for example, a `swift_library` that
depends on an `objc_library` that depends on a `swift_library`).

It also manages module map generation for `cc_library` targets that have the
`swift_module` tag. This tag may take one of two forms:

    *   `swift_module`: By itself, this indicates that the target is compatible
        with Swift and should be given a module name that is derived from its
        target label.
    *   `swift_module=name`: The module should be given the name `name`.

Note that the public headers of such `cc_library` targets must be parsable as C,
since Swift does not support C++ interop at this time.

Most users will not need to interact directly with this aspect, since it is
automatically applied to the `deps` attribute of all `swift_binary`,
`swift_library`, and `swift_test` targets. However, some rules may need to
provide custom propagation logic of C/Objective-C module dependencies; for
example, a rule that has a support library as a private attribute would need to
ensure that `SwiftInfo` providers for that library and its dependencies are
propagated to any targets that depend on it, since they would not be propagated
via `deps`. In this case, the custom rule can attach this aspect to that support
library's attribute and then merge its `SwiftInfo` provider with any others that
it propagates for its targets.
