        actions: The object used to register actions.
        action_environment: A `dict` of environment variables that should be set for the compile
            action.
        clang_executable: The path to the `clang` executable that will be invoked to link, which is
            assumed to be present among the tools that the toolchain passes to its action
            registrars. If this is `None`, then simply `clang` will be used with the assumption that
            the registrar knows where and how to find it.
        deps: A list of `deps` representing additional libraries that will be passed to the linker.
        expanded_linkopts: A list of strings representing options passed to the linker. Any
            `$(location ...)` placeholders are assumed to have already been expanded.
        inputs: A `depset` containing additional inputs to the link action, such as those used in
            `$(location ...)` substitution, or libraries that need to be linked.
        mnemonic: The mnemonic printed by Bazel when the action executes.
        objects: A list of object (.o) files that will be passed to the linker.
        outputs: A list of `File`s that should be passed as the outputs of the link action.
        rule_specific_args: Additional arguments that are rule-specific that will be passed to
            `clang`.
        toolchain: The `SwiftToolchainInfo` provider of the toolchain.
