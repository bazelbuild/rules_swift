**iOS** instead of macOS. Therefore, if you wish to build a simple single-architecture Swift
binary that can run on macOS, you must specify the correct CPU and platform on the command line as
follows:

```shell
$ bazel build //package:target

Compiles and links Swift code into an executable test target.

The behavior of `swift_test` differs slightly for macOS targets, in order to provide seamless
integration with Apple's XCTest framework. The output of the rule is still a binary, but one whose
Mach-O type is `MH_BUNDLE` (a loadable bundle). Thus, the binary cannot be launched directly.
Instead, running `bazel test` on the target will launch a test runner script that copies it into an
`.xctest` bundle directory and then launches the `xctest` helper tool from Xcode, which uses
Objective-C runtime reflection to locate the tests.

On Linux, the output of a `swift_test` is a standard executable binary, because the implementation
of XCTest on that platform currently requires authors to explicitly list the tests that are present
and run them from their main program.

Test bundling on macOS can be disabled on a per-target basis, if desired. You may wish to do this if
you are not using XCTest, but rather a different test framework (or no framework at all) where the
pass/fail outcome is represented as a zero/non-zero exit code (as is the case with other Bazel test
rules like `cc_test`). To do so, disable the `"swift.bundled_xctests"` feature on the target:

```python
swift_test(
    name = "MyTests",
    srcs = [...],
    features = ["-swift.bundled_xctests"],
)
```

You can also disable this feature for all the tests in a package by applying it to your BUILD file's
`package()` declaration instead of the individual targets.
