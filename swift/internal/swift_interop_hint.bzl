Some build rules, such as `objc_library`, support interoperability with Swift
simply by depending on them; a module map is generated automatically. This is
for convenience, because the common case is that most `objc_library` targets
contain code that is compatible (i.e., capable of being imported) by Swift.

For other rules, like `cc_library`, additional information must be provided to
indicate that a particular target is compatible with Swift. This is done using
the `aspect_hints` attribute and the `swift_interop_hint` rule.

#### Using the automatically derived module name (recommended)

If you want to import a non-Swift, non-Objective-C target into Swift using the
module name that is automatically derived from the BUILD label, there is no need
to declare an instance of `swift_interop_hint`. A canonical one that requests
module name derivation has been provided in
`@build_bazel_rules_swift//swift:auto_module`. Simply add it to the `aspect_hints` of
the target you wish to import:

```build
# //my/project/BUILD
cc_library(
    name = "somelib",
    srcs = ["somelib.c"],
    hdrs = ["somelib.h"],
    aspect_hints = ["@build_bazel_rules_swift//swift:auto_module"],
)
```

When this `cc_library` is a dependency of a Swift target, a module map will be
generated for it. In this case, the module's name would be `my_project_somelib`.

#### Using an explicit module name

If you need to provide an explicit name for the module (for example, if it is
part of a third-party library that expects to be imported with a specific name),
then you can declare your own `swift_interop_hint` target to define the name:

```build
# //my/project/BUILD
cc_library(
    name = "somelib",
    srcs = ["somelib.c"],
    hdrs = ["somelib.h"],
    aspect_hints = [":somelib_swift_interop"],
)

swift_interop_hint(
    name = "somelib_swift_interop",
    module_name = "CSomeLib",
)
```

When this `cc_library` is a dependency of a Swift target, a module map will be
generated for it with the module name `CSomeLib`.

#### Using a custom module map

In rare cases, the automatically generated module map may not be suitable. For
example, a Swift module may depend on a C module that defines specific
submodules, and this is not handled by the Swift build rules. In this case, you
can provide the module map file using the `module_map` attribute.

When setting the `module_map` attribute, `module_name` must also be set to the
name of the desired top-level module; it cannot be omitted.

```build
# //my/project/BUILD
cc_library(
    name = "somelib",
    srcs = ["somelib.c"],
    hdrs = ["somelib.h"],
    aspect_hints = [":somelib_swift_interop"],
)

swift_interop_hint(
    name = "somelib_swift_interop",
    module_map = "module.modulemap",
    module_name = "CSomeLib",
)
```
""",
    implementation = _swift_interop_hint_impl,
)
