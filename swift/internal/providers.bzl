    At least one of the `clang` and `swift` arguments must not be `None`. It is
    valid for both to be present; this is the case for most Swift modules, which
    provide both Swift module artifacts as well as a generated header/module map
    for Objective-C targets to depend on.

    Args:
        name: The name of the module.
        clang: A value returned by `swift_common.create_clang_module` that
            contains artifacts related to Clang modules, such as a module map or
            precompiled module. This may be `None` if the module is a pure Swift
            module with no generated Objective-C interface.
        is_system: Indicates whether the module is a system module. The default
            value is `False`. System modules differ slightly from non-system
            modules in the way that they are passed to the compiler. For
            example, non-system modules have their Clang module maps passed to
            the compiler in both implicit and explicit module builds. System
            modules, on the other hand, do not have their module maps passed to
            the compiler in implicit module builds because there is currently no
            way to indicate that modules declared in a file passed via
            `-fmodule-map-file` should be treated as system modules even if they
            aren't declared with the `[system]` attribute, and some system
            modules may not build cleanly with respect to warnings otherwise.
            Therefore, it is assumed that any module with `is_system == True`
            must be able to be found using import search paths in order for
            implicit module builds to succeed.
        swift: A value returned by `swift_common.create_swift_module` that
            contains artifacts related to Swift modules, such as the
            `.swiftmodule`, `.swiftdoc`, and/or `.swiftinterface` files emitted
