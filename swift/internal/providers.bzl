        name,
        clang = None,

    """Creates a value containing Clang/Swift module artifacts of a dependency.

    It is possible for both `clang` and `swift` to be present; this is the case
    for Swift modules that generate an Objective-C header, where the Swift
    module artifacts are propagated in the `swift` context and the generated
    header and module map are propagated in the `clang` context.

    Though rare, it is also permitted for both the `clang` and `swift` arguments
    to be `None`. One example of how this can be used is to model system
    dependencies (like Apple SDK frameworks) that are implicitly available as
    part of a non-hermetic SDK (Xcode) but do not propagate any artifacts of
    their own. This would only apply in a build using implicit modules, however;
    when using explicit modules, one would propagate the module artifacts
    explicitly. But allowing for the empty case keeps the build graph consistent
    if switching between the two modes is necessary, since it will not change
    the set of transitive module names that are propagated by dependencies
    (which other build rules may want to depend on for their own analysis).

    Args:
        name: The name of the module.
        clang: A value returned by `swift_common.create_clang_module` that
            contains artifacts related to Clang modules, such as a module map or
            precompiled module. This may be `None` if the module is a pure Swift
            module with no generated Objective-C interface.
        const_gather_protocols: A list of protocol names from which constant
            values should be extracted from source code that takes this module
            as a *direct* dependency.
        compilation_context: A value returned from
            `swift_common.create_compilation_context` that contains the
            context needed to compile the module being built. This may be `None`
            if the module wasn't compiled from sources.
        is_system: Indicates whether the module is a system module. The default
            value is `False`. System modules differ slightly from non-system
            modules in the way that they are passed to the compiler. For
            example, non-system modules have their Clang module maps passed to
            the compiler in both implicit and explicit module builds. System
            modules, on the other hand, do not have their module maps passed to
            the compiler in implicit module builds because there is currently no
            way to indicate that modules declared in a file passed via
            `-fmodule-map-file` should be treated as system modules even if they
            aren't declared with the `[system]` attribute, and some system
            modules may not build cleanly with respect to warnings otherwise.
            Therefore, it is assumed that any module with `is_system == True`
            must be able to be found using import search paths in order for
            implicit module builds to succeed.
        swift: A value returned by `swift_common.create_swift_module` that
            contains artifacts related to Swift modules, such as the
            `.swiftmodule`, `.swiftdoc`, and/or `.swiftinterface` files emitted
            by the compiler. This may be `None` if the module is a pure
            C/Objective-C module.

        fields provided as arguments.

        module_map: The text module map file that defines this module. This
