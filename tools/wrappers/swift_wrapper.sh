# SYNOPSIS
#   Invokes a Swift tool, adding custom pre- and post-invocation behavior
#   needed by the Bazel build rules.
#
#   This script recognizes special arguments of the form
#   `-Xwrapped-swift=<arg>` to enable special behaviors. These arguments must
#   be passed directly on the command line; for performance reasons this script
#   does not process params files. Arguments of this form are consumed entirely
#   by this wrapper and are not passed down to the Swift tool (however, they
#   may add normal arguments that would be passed).
#
# USAGE
#   swift_wrapper <executable> <arguments...>
#
# ARGUMENTS
#   executable: The executable to invoke. This should be a tool in the Swift
#       toolchain, or a similar invocation (like `xcrun` followed by a Swift
#       tool).
#   arguments...: Arguments that are either processed by the wrapper or passed
#       directly to the underlying Swift tool.
#
#   The following wrapper-specific arguments are supported:
#
#   -Xwrapped-swift=-ephemeral-module-cache
#       When specified, the wrapper will create a new temporary directory, pass
#       that to the Swift compiler using `-module-cache-path`, and then delete
#       the directory afterwards. This should resolve issues where the module
#       cache state is not refreshed correctly in all situations, which
#       sometimes results in hard-to-diagnose crashes in `swiftc`.

set -eu

# Called when the wrapper exits (normally or abnormally) to clean up any
# temporary state.
function cleanup {
  if [[ -n "$MODULE_CACHE_DIR" ]] ; then
    rm -rf "$MODULE_CACHE_DIR"
  fi
}
